Blackjack
A game by Ali Purdum and Ana Knighten

Gameplay:
Goal - Get exactly 21 points in your hand (Blackjack), or the highest score
Cards are worth 2-11 points (face cards = 10 and ace = 11)
You start the game with two cards. You can see one of the Dealer’s cards.
Place a bet based on how likely you think you are to win (i.e. $10).

Select either “Stay” or “Hit”.
“Stay” means that you don’t want any more cards.
“Hit” means that you want another card from the deck.

If you get over 21 points you ‘bust’, and the Dealer wins. 
If you reach 21 you automatically win with a “Blackjack”.
If you stay, it becomes the Dealer’s turn. 

After the Dealer’s turn the round ends.
If you win, you receive twice the amount of your bet.
If you lose, you lose the amount of your bet.
